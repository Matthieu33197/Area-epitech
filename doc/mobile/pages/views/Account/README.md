# The "Account" folder

### As we can see here, we have the skeleton of our Account page.

This skeleton includes the profile viewer that displays: the profile pictures, name and email as well as the logout button. It also includes a section dedicated to the services where we can subscribe and unsubscribe from some services.

<summary>'Services' folder</summary>
<br>
The 'Services' folder contains all the information related to the subscriptions, and the authentication (if needed). This allows the 'Service Settings' button (located in the profile section) to work. Inside the folder we can find all the function that help display the list of services avaible.
