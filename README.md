# AREA

## The Project:
The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the creation of a business application.
To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.
This software suite will be broken into three parts :

- Anapplication server to implement all the features listed below (seeFeatures)
- A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
- A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server

## Documentation:

- Mobile: [Flutter](/doc/mobile/)
- Web: [React](/doc/web/)
- Backend: [JavaScript](/doc/backend/)



## Installation

At the root of the repository, you can find a file named "start.sh". This is the main script that lets you use our project:

In order to start the project **FOR THE FIRST TIME**:
```sh
./start.sh re
```
After that, you can relaunch the project with the following commands:
```sh
./start.sh
```

To remove EVRYTHING:
```sh
./start.sh fcl
```
